# Agent Notes

- Default to the Medusa JS SDK for interacting with Medusa resources. Avoid direct fetch calls unless the SDK cannot cover the need, and document any exception.
- Local JS SDK docs (auth, store, admin) live in `../docs/js-sdk`; consult those for method shapes instead of “latest” online docs.
